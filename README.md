# Deep_Learning_Predicting_Customer_Churn_Rate
Project Description: Developed Artificial Neural Networks to Predict Customer Churn in Business. By gathering data on customer behavior and training an ANN model, businesses can predict which customers are likely to churn in the future. This enables businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers and prevent revenue loss. This model was able to achieve a 93% accuracy score.
